Dear Professor,
Thank you for your congratulatory message and for offering to schedule a video call. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss further.

Given our different time zones (West Lafayette, IN and New Delhi), I recommend using Savvy Time to help us find a suitable time that aligns with both West Lafayette and Delhi time zones. I am generally available during early morning or late evening U.S. time, which aligns well with my afternoon or evening hours here. Please let me know if any specific times work for you, or feel free to suggest an alternative.

Could you also please confirm which video conferencing platform you prefer to use (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)? I will ensure I have the necessary setup ready before our call.

Thank you for your time and consideration.


Best regards,
Aryamann
